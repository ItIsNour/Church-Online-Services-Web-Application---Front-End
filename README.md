## Overview

Kenesty is a front-end web application developed to provide users with a friendly and intuitive interface for exploring and participating in various church services and rituals. The project prioritizes user experience design to ensure seamless navigation and engagement.

## User Interface Design

### Intuitive Navigation

Semantic HTML elements, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation support are implemented to enhance accessibility.
